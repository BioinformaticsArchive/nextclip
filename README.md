NextClip
========

Nextera Long Mate Pair analysis and processing tool. See manual for installation and instructions.

The 'examples' directory contains example reports and a partial set of reads for a (relatively low quality) Nextera library. To use this data with the NextClip pipeline (as opposed to just the basic NextClip tool), a Streptomyces coelicolor reference is required, which is not supplied here.
